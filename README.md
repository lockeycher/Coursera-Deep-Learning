# Deep-Learning

This repository contains materials(mainly programming assignments)) of deeplearning.ai Deep Learning Specialization taught by Andrew Ng on coursera. 5 topics cover:
* Neural Networks and Deep Learning
* Improving Deep Neural Networks
* Structuring Machine Learning Projects
* Convolutional Neural Networks
* Sequence Models

Goal of this specialization:
In five courses, you will learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. You will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. You will work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing.

Skills:
* Tensorflow
* Convolutional Neural Network
* Artificial Neural Network
* Deep Learning
